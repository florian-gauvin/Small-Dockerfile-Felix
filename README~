Here is a Dockerfile that can build a small docker image with Openjdk8 and Apache Felix in it for the Inaetics project. The purpose of this Dockerfile is to build fast the image and to have a "builder image" as small as possible.
If you want more details you can see the comment in the Dockerfile or for even more details you can see this github : https://github.com/florian-gauvin/Dockerfile-that-build-a-small-Docker-Image-with-Openjdk-and-Apache-Felix-in-it/blob/openjdk8-built-outside-of-buildroot/ . In this github there is dockerfile with all the steps and all the details about my work.

To use this dockerfile :
First, build the dockerfile by running the following command : docker build -t "name-of-the-felix-image-builder" .
This will create a builder image of Apache Felix
Then Run the following command :
docker run -ti --privileged -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock name-of-the-celix-image-builder
This will launch the builder image of Apache Felix and create automatically the small image with Openjdk8
and Apache Felix in it.
Finally you will have a docker image named inaetics/felix-agent on your host, you can check by running the following command :
"docker images".

BE CAREFUL :
-You need to have the same docker version than there is in the image, in the image I'm
using the latest version of docker by running the following command : wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh
